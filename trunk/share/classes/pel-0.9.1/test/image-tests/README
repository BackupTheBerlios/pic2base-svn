PEL Test Images
***************

The images contained in this directory are test images collected for
use with PEL: PHP Exif Library.  One can download PEL from:

  http://pel.sourceforge.net/

All images except no-exif.jpg contain Exif information, and the
corresponding PHP files contain SimpleTest (http://simpletest.sf.net/)
unit tests.

To use those files with PEL, simply place this directory (the
image-tests directory) under the test directory in an unpacked PEL
source tree.  Then run the test.php script, which will now
automatically pickup the new tests.

The images can be used by anybody, but may only be redistributed under
the GNU GPL.  See the file COPYING for the details.


Contributing Test Images
************************

If you own a camera model from which there are no test image, then
please contribute one.  The image should

* contain as much interesting Exif tags as possible.  The camera
  should therefore be set to a manual mode, and the settings should be
  changed from their defaults,

* have as small a file size as possible, so use a resolution of
  640x480 or less, if possible.  Also, use the poorest image quality
  (the best compression) to reduce the file size.

* come from the camera unaltered.  Do not resize the image using an
  image manipulation program, for then it is this program that will be
  tested, not the camera that took the image,

* be of something which wont protest to be widely published on the
  net.  Things like a flower, a mountain, or a cat springs to mind,
  whereas pictures from a private party are no good,

* be licensed under the GNU GPL as the rest of PEL Test Images, so
  that it can be redistributed with it.

Submit your test image(s) using the SourceForge Patch Tracker found at

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=108380&atid=650324

All image contributers will be given full credit in the AUTHORS file
distributed with PEL and on the PEL homepage at http://pel.sf.net/.
